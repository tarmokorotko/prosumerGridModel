# Prosumer Grid Model
Distribution grid modelling through Prosumer modelling objects in MATLAB Simulink

# General
This repository contains necessary resources to realize an electric power distribution system through the use of prosumer objects. The main purpose for the provided tools is to simplify object modelling for simulating EPS load-flow and developing energy management systems (EMS) or optimization methods.
